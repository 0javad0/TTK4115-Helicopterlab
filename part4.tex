\section{Part 4 -- State estimation}
This section consists of the development of an observer to estimate the
nonmeasured angular velocities.
%
\subsection{Problem 1}
By describing the system in \cref{eq:linearized EoM} in the following
state-space form
%
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \dot{\bm{x}} &= \bm{Ax} + \bm{Bu} \\
    \bm{y} &= \bm{Cx}
  \end{split}
\end{align}
%
where  $\bm{A}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{C}$ are matrices. The state -,
input - and output vector are given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:state_space_vectors}
  \bm{x} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \tilde{p} \\
    \dot{\tilde{p}} \\
    \tilde{e} \\
    \dot{\tilde{e}} \\
    \tilde{\lambda} \\
    \dot{\tilde{\lambda}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  , \quad \bm{u} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \tilde{V_s} \\
    \tilde{V_d} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \quad \text{andc} \quad \bm{y} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \tilde{p} \\
    \tilde{e} \\
    \tilde{\lambda}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
This gives the following $\bm{A}$, $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{C}$ matrices
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:state_space_A_B_C}
  \bm{A} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    K_3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  , \quad \bm{B} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & K_1 \\
    0 & 0 \\
    K_2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \quad \text{and} \quad \bm{C} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
Where $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$ are given by \cref{eq:linearized EoM}.
%
\subsection{Problem 2}
The observer matrix can be used. For a 6 state system, it is defined by:
\begin{equation}
  \bm{\mathcal{O}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \bm{C} \\
    \bm{CA} \\
    \bm{C*A^2} \\
    \bm{C*A^3} \\
    \bm{C*A^4} \\
    \bm{C*A^5} \\
  \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{equation}
This can be calculated using MATLAB's $obsv(\bm{A},\bm{C})$
function. The resulting 18x6 matrix has rank 6, thereby full rank.
%
% &=\begin{bmatrix}
%   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
%   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
%   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
%   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
%   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
%   0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
% \end{bmatrix}
% \end{align*}
Since it has full rank, the system is fully observable.

The observer gain matrix $\bm{L}$ is to be set in such a way that the
poles of the observer are faster than the system, in order to drive the
error to zero.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{ illustrating how to place poles during state, or estimated
    state feedback, on a semi-circle with the same radius, within the
    region shown.}
  \label{fig:pole_placement}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/pole_placement}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
\todo[inline]{Finn navnene p√• theta og sigma i forhold til regtek} It is recommended that the
poles of the observer be placed as in
\cref{fig:pole_placement}. The real value of the observer poles must be larger
than $\sigma$, which for the observer is the value of the largest real
value of the controlled systems poles. This way, all of the linear
observers poles are such that the observer is faster than the controlled system. $\theta$ is the
largest angle of the observer poles. If this is too large, the system will be underdamped and cause
overshoots in the estimate. However, if the radius is too large, undesired high
frequency noise from the measurements becomes amplified to unwanted
levels. Furthermore, the observer will become increasingly unstable the closer the poles are.

$\theta = 15$, and $r$ as 50 times the maximum length of the
controlled systems poles worked well for this system.

The observer itself has the state space formulation:

\begin{equation*}
  \dot{\hat{\bm{x}}} = \bm{A}\hat{\bm{x}}+\bm{B}\bm{u} + \bm{L}(\bm{y}
  - \bm{C}\hat{\bm{x}})
\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
  \dot{\bm{e}} &= \dot{\bm{\tilde{x}}} - \dot{\hat{\bm{x}}} \\
               &= \bm{Ax} + \bm{Bu} - \bm{A}\hat{\bm{x}} - \bm{Bu} - \bm{L}(\bm{y}- \bm{C}\hat{\bm{x}}) \\
               &= \bm{A}(\bm{x} - \hat{\bm{x}}) - \bm{L}(\bm{C}\bm{x}- \bm{C}\hat{\bm{x}}) \\
               &= \bm{Ae} - \bm{LCe} \\
\end{align*}
Meaning the error has the state space formulation:
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\bm{e}} = (\bm{A} - \bm{LC})\bm{e}
\end{equation}
As previously stated, for this error to converge to zero the poles of this state space formulation should be placed such that they are
faster than the poles of the system itself. The poles of this state
space system can be placed arbitrarily because $\{\bm{A},\bm{C}\}$ is
observable:
\begin{equation*}
  det(\lambda\bm{I} - \bm{A} +\bm{LC}) = 0
\end{equation*}
For this equation, $\lambda$ are the values that solves the equation,
and also the poles of the observer. By choosing values for $\lambda$,
an $\bm{L}$ emerges in order to make the determinant equal to
zero. The matlab function $place$ places the poles as desired for us:

$\bm{L} = place(\bm{A}^T,\bm{C}^T,\bm{\lambda})^T$, where
$\bm{\lambda}$ is the vector of the observer poles in this instance.

In \cref{fig:LQR_Estimator} the poles are palced on the real line at -20, -40, -60, -80, -100, and -120. This type of observer has minimal overshoot, as there are no complex parts, and the poles are spread far apart to avoid unstable behavior from the observer. Furthermore, the maximum radius is also rather large leading to a fast response. Placing the poles on the real line like this was slightly better than placing them evenly on a circle with radius $r = 60$, and an angle $\theta = 22.5$, because with this pole setup the observer was too oscillatory.

\subsection{Problem 3}

When only $\tilde{e}$ and $\tilde{\lambda}$ are measured, the output
matrix becomes:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \bm{C} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
The observer matrix, found through $obsv(\bm{A},\bm{C})$ is a 12x6
matrix with rank 6. Therefore, it is observable.

However, when only $\tilde{p}$ and $\tilde{e}$ are measured, the
output matrix becomes:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \bm{C} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
%
The observer matrix, found through $obsv(\bm{A},\bm{C})$ is a 12x6
matrix with rank 4. Therefore, it is not observable.

Quicknotes: tried one pole close to the system poles, and the rest out but close to the real line.
Noticed an underdamped behaviour of the elevation rate, estimate was slightly higher than the true state.
Tried complex conjugated poles slightly further out of the real line, got a much better response.

More notes: Larger observer poles also means larger $\bm{u}$ values

This observer is particularly challenging to implement due to the fact that pitch is measured based on the travel rate, which is based on travel. This means the estimator has to filter out two layers of measurement noise. This means that choosing the observer poles becomes difficult because as the radius of the poles increases it begins to amplify this noise.
